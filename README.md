Financial Fraud Detection Project
This repository contains a machine learning project to proactively detect fraudulent financial transactions. The solution was developed as part of a screening assignment and demonstrates a full data science workflow, from data analysis and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

The primary goal is to build a robust model that accurately identifies fraudulent activities, helping a financial company minimize losses and protect its customers.

üöÄ Project Overview
The project tackles the challenge of identifying fraudulent transactions within a large dataset. The core of the solution is a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful algorithm chosen for its high accuracy and its ability to handle the complex and imbalanced nature of fraud data.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning: The dataset was analyzed for inconsistencies and prepared for the modeling phase.

Feature Engineering: New, highly predictive features (errorBalanceOrig, errorBalanceDest) were engineered to capture transactional discrepancies that are strong indicators of fraud.

Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier was trained on the dataset, using a balanced class weight strategy to address the severe class imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Performance: The final model demonstrates excellent performance, capable of identifying a high percentage of fraudulent transactions while keeping false positives to a minimum.

üìä Key Results & Findings
The model's performance was evaluated on a held-out test set, yielding strong results:

Precision (for Fraud class): 98% (When the model predicts a transaction is fraudulent, it is correct 98% of the time).

Recall (for Fraud class): 75% (The model successfully identifies 75% of all actual fraudulent transactions).

ROC AUC Score: 0.999 (Indicates outstanding capability to distinguish between classes).

Top 5 Predictors of Fraud:
The model identified the following features as the most important for detecting fraudulent activity:

errorBalanceOrig: The error in the originator's account balance after the transaction.

step: The specific time unit in the simulation, indicating temporal patterns.

type_PAYMENT: The type of transaction (used as a strong indicator of non-fraud).

amount: The monetary value of the transaction.

oldbalanceOrg: The initial balance of the sender's account.
